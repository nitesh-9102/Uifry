Hey there! The project's media is all stored locally and is then placed according to the design give in the figma file.

- I've used librarairs like "gsap" to add a bit of interactivity among the elements of the project that occurs on scrolling and also used  
  "scroll trigger" to make sure the animations are visible on scroll on different parts of the webpage.
- And coming to the responsiveness I've used the display of "Iphone 14pro max" as refernce for my media queiries .
- The project has been deployed on "Netlify". I've used netlify to maintain a consistency and track of projects personally.
  -I've tried to replicate the exact design from the figma file and hopfully gave my best to achieve the required.
  -thanky you.
